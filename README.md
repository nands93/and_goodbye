# College Game Re-release with SDL2

This project is a re-release of a little game I originally developed in collage. The initial version utilized a proprietary graphics library provided by them. To make the project publicly accessible, I have recreated it using the SDL2 library, allowing for cross-platform compatibility and open-source distribution.

## About the Game
This game is written in C and leverages SDL2 for rendering, input handling, and other multimedia functions. It preserves the core gameplay from the original version but benefits from the flexibility and support provided by SDL2.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Run on Windows, macOS, and Linux with SDL2.
- **Simple Graphics and Gameplay:** Focuses on core gameplay mechanics.
- **Educational Purpose:** Ideal for learning the basics of game development in C.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To build and run this project, you will need:
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) installed on your system.
- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc` for Linux and macOS or `MinGW` for Windows).
